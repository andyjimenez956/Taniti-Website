        <h2>Welcome to Taniti</h2>
        <p>
            Taniti is a small tropical island in the Pacific with fewer than 500 square miles of land.
            The island offers a mix of sandy and rocky beaches, a safe natural harbor, lush rainforest,
            and a mountainous interior with an active volcano. Taniti is home to an indigenous population
            of about 20,000 residents.
        </p>
        <p>
            For many years, local life was centered on fishing and agriculture. As tourism has grown,
            new opportunities have opened for visitors to experience Taniti’s culture, landscape, and
            hospitality.
